# Output-Sensitive-Construction-of-Reeb-Graphs
This algorithm maximally leverages the efficient algorithms available to compute the loop- free version of the Reeb graph. It partitions the input into subsets whose Reeb graph do not contain any loops and merges the loop-free graphs in linear time to construct the Reeb graph of the input. The algorithm has a running time of O(t log t + l + n)
